The  Problem 

The surface of Mars can be modelled by a rectangular grid around which robots are able to
move according to instructions provided from Earth. You are to write a program that
determines each sequence of robot positions and reports the final position of the robot.
A robot position consists of a grid coordinate (a pair of integers: x-coordinate followed by
y-coordinate) and an orientation (N, S, E, W for north, south, east, and west).

1. I used TDD, to drive the functionality
2. Kotlin language was used.
3. I have created separate tests, to allow for independent testing of other classes outside of the Robot class.
